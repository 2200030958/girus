# Technical Coding Interview Round - Solutions

Welcome to my submission repository for the **Technical Coding Interview Round** held on June 9, 2025.

This repo contains solutions to all the coding problems provided, implemented in Python. Each problem is solved in a dedicated file with test cases included. The solutions aim for clarity, correctness, and efficiency.

## Problems and Solutions

### Problem 1: Sudoku Validator With Custom Zones

* **File:** `sudoku_validator.py`
* **Description:** Validates a standard 9x9 Sudoku board with additional checks for custom zones ensuring digits 1-9 appear without repetition.
* **Usage:** Run the file to see sample test cases validating different boards.


### Problem 2: Alien Dictionary

* **File:** `alien_dictionary.py`
* **Description:** Given a sorted list of words from an alien language, determines the character order used in that language using topological sorting.
* **Usage:** Execute the script to run built-in test cases demonstrating character order detection.


### Problem 3: Knights and Portals

* **File:** `knights_and_portals.py`
* **Description:** Finds the shortest path from top-left to bottom-right in a grid, with the option to teleport exactly once between any two empty cells.
* **Usage:** Run the file to test different grid configurations and path results.


### Problem 4: Bitwise Matching Pattern

* **File:** `bitwise_matching_pattern.py`
* **Description:** Given an integer `n`, returns the next larger integer that has the same number of set bits (1s) in its binary representation.
* **Usage:** Execute to see results on various input numbers.


### Problem 5: Matrix Islands with Diagonals

* **File:** `matrix_islands_with_diagonals.py`
* **Description:** Counts the number of islands in a matrix where islands are formed by horizontally, vertically, or diagonally connected 1s.
* **Usage:** Run the script to observe counting on sample matrices.


### Bonus Challenge: Mini Interpreter

* **File:** `mini_interpreter.py`
* **Description:** A simple interpreter that supports `let` variable declarations and `if-then-else` conditional execution from input strings.
* **Usage:** Run the file to see variable assignments and conditional logic in action.



## Setup & Running Instructions

1. **Prerequisites:**

   * Python 3.x installed on your machine.

2. **Running Solutions:**
   Each solution file contains a test function that runs sample test cases.
   Open a terminal in the project directory and execute:

   python <filename>.py

   Replace `<filename>` with the actual file name, for example:
   python sudoku_validator.py

3. **Adding Your Own Tests:**
   You can add new test cases by modifying the test functions in each file or creating new functions as needed.



## Testing

* Each problem file includes test cases with sample inputs and expected outputs.
* Run the file to verify correctness.
* Output is printed to the console for easy verification.


## Code Quality and Style

* Code is modular, readable, and free of unnecessary comments for clarity.
* Functions are designed to be reusable and testable.
* No external libraries are used, relying solely on Python standard libraries.
* The solutions are original and written by me without plagiarism.
